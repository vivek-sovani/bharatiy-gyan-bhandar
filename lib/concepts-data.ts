            'The Gītā transforms the karma doctrine from a mechanism of bondage into a path of liberation. The problem karma poses is acute: every action leaves a residue that binds the actor to its consequences. Kṛṣṇa\'s answer is niṣkāma-karma — action without desire for its fruits: "you have a right to perform your duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions; let not the fruits of action be your motive, nor let attachment to inaction be yours" (2.47). The actor does not cease acting — that is impossible — but acts as an instrument of the universal order, consecrating every deed to Kṛṣṇa, so that no residue accumulates. Karma-yoga thus reframes the doctrine: not an iron causal law to be escaped, but a daily discipline to be mastered.',

Yoga, following Patañjali, analyses karma as cumulative conditioning: karmas have their roots in the afflictions (kleśas — ignorance, ego, attraction, aversion and the fear of death) and produce their effects in present and future lives. The eightfold yogic discipline both prevents new karma from forming and burns off accumulated karma through austerity (tapas), making Yoga a systematic technology for dismantling the karmic mechanism from the inside.',

Karma is thus a feature of the process, not of an abiding agent. Jainism takes the most literal view: karma is a fine material substance that physically adheres to the soul (jīva) in proportion to the soul\'s passions, weighing it down and binding it to saṃsāra. Liberation requires simultaneously stopping new karma (saṃvara) and burning off accumulated karma (nirjarā) through austerity.

        'Rasa — literally "juice" or "flavour" — is the savoured emotional essence that a work of drama, poetry or music evokes. First set out by Bharata in the Nāṭyaśāstra, it is the organising idea of all Indian aesthetics.',
      aspects: [
        'Bharata names eight (later nine) rasas — the erotic, comic, pathetic, furious, heroic, fearful, disgustful, marvellous (and the peaceful).',
        'A durable emotion (sthāyi-bhāva) in the audience is raised, by the play of the work, into relishable rasa.',
        'Abhinavagupta gave it its deepest form: rasa as a self-luminous, impersonal delight akin to spiritual bliss.',
      ],
      significance:
        'Rasa theory underlies every classical Indian art — dance, drama, music and poetry — and remains the central category through which they are made and judged.',
